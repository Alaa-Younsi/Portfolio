## 📋 Overview

My current main portfolio. A framed, interstellar-themed single-page application built entirely from scratch with React and Vite — no UI libraries, no component frameworks. Every animation, every interactive element is hand-coded. The design philosophy is minimal, dark, and typographic: white borders on black, monospace text, physics-based particles, and a scientifically-inspired black hole as the centrepiece.

## ✨ Features

### Layout & Design
- **Framed card UI** — white border frame on full-viewport black background, consistent on all screen sizes
- **Dark / Light mode** — manual toggle, CSS variable-driven theme switching (`--bg`, `--fg`, `--border`)
- **Fully responsive** — custom Tailwind breakpoints (`xs: 375px`, `sm: 640px`, `md–2xl`)
- **Monospace typographic system** — `clamp()`-based fluid type scaling throughout

### Animations & Interactivity
- **Animated star field** — Canvas API particle system; stars follow pointer/touch parallax within the frame boundary using clipping paths; device-pixel-ratio aware
- **Interstellar black hole** — Physics-based Canvas animation with Keplerian orbital motion, Doppler colour shift (blue-shift approaching, red-shift receding), and gravitational lensing glow; explodes on click/tap
- **Splash screen** — Fade-out intro on first load
- **Typing animations** — Character-by-character text reveal for every section (Hero bio, Projects list, Skills, About, Contact) built with `useState`/`useEffect` state machines
- **Glitch text effect** — CSS `text-shadow` animation on all headings and links, intensifies on hover; `::before`/`::after` pseudo-elements for layered glitch
- **Blinking cursor** — Animated `|` cursor during active typing sequences

### Sections
| Section | Description |
|---|---|
| **Home** | Typing biography (bottom-right), external project links with glitch effect (bottom-left), interactive black hole |
| **Projects** | Sequential typing reveal of 8 live projects with labels and titles; inner scroll container clipped to frame |
| **Skills** | Animated skills list |
| **Info (About)** | Biography and background |
| **Contact** | Linktree link with glitch effect |

## 🎯 Portfolio Philosophy

The design rejects the typical "card grid on white background" portfolio format. Instead it treats the portfolio itself as a project — something that demonstrates craft, not just lists it.

1. **Code as art** — every visual effect is written by hand; nothing is imported from a component library
2. **Performance as design** — animations run on `canvas` and GPU-composited layers, never forcing layout reflows
3. **Restraint** — one font family, two colours, no images except project screenshots; the work speaks through motion and text
4. **Real device parity** — mobile experience is engineered to match desktop exactly, not just "responsive"

---

## ✅ Best Practices

### Performance
- Canvas animations use `requestAnimationFrame` with a single loop; no `setInterval` timers on the render path
- Star field and black hole each run on a single `<canvas>` element (no multi-layer canvas stacking)
- `willChange: 'scroll-position'` on the Projects scroll container promotes it to its own compositing layer
- Background `touchmove` listener registered as `{ passive: true }` — never blocks the browser's scroll compositor thread
- Global CSS `transition` rule scoped to `opacity` only — `transform` excluded to prevent full repaints on every scroll frame
- Fonts loaded via `<link rel="preconnect">` + single Google Fonts request with `display=swap`
- Vite tree-shaking eliminates all unused code at build time

### Mobile
- Viewport units use `dvh` (dynamic viewport height) so layout recalculates correctly when the mobile URL bar expands/collapses
- `html`, `body`, `#root` locked to `height: 100%; overflow: hidden` — prevents page-level body scroll and viewport stretch on swipe
- Projects section: `touch-action: pan-y` on both the section and scroll container; `overscroll-behavior: contain` prevents scroll chaining
- CSS `clip-path: inset(var(--frame-y) var(--frame-x))` on the canvas enforces hard GPU-level clipping at the frame boundary on mobile compositors

### SEO
- `react-helmet-async` manages `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`, canonical URL
- Full Open Graph tags (`og:type`, `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:url`, `og:site_name`)
- Twitter Card tags (`twitter:card`, `twitter:title`, `twitter:description`, `twitter:creator`)
- `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` in `/public`
- Semantic HTML: `<section>` with `aria-labelledby`, `<h2>` headings per section

### Accessibility
- All interactive elements have `aria-label` attributes
- External links include `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"` and `aria-label` describing destination
- Theme toggle button has dynamic `aria-label` reflecting current mode
- `<button type="button">` used for all non-form buttons to prevent accidental form submission

### Security
- All external links use `rel="noopener noreferrer"` preventing tab-napping and `window.opener` leaks
- No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` anywhere in the codebase
- No user input fields — no XSS surface
- `vercel.json` handles routing; no server logic exposed

### Code Quality
- ESLint flat config with `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` (enforces Rules of Hooks) and `eslint-plugin-react-refresh` (HMR safety)
- All `useEffect` hooks have correct dependency arrays
- No unused state setters (converted to constants where setter is never called)
- Component-level `if (active !== "section") return null` guards prevent off-screen renders

## ⚡ Why This Portfolio Stands Out

1. **Zero UI libraries** — every interactive element is original code; no Framer Motion, no shadcn, no component kit
2. **Physics-accurate black hole** — Keplerian orbital mechanics and Doppler colour shift implemented on Canvas, inspired by *Interstellar*
3. **Engineered for real devices** — most mobile bugs are invisible in DevTools emulation; this was tested and fixed on real Android hardware
4. **Typography-first design** — the entire visual language is built on a single monospace font family, fluid type scaling, and deliberate whitespace
5. **Performant by construction** — compositor-thread animations, passive event listeners, and `dvh` viewport handling chosen from the ground up
